### Story: -/5

Overall, I can't say I know much about the story of this game. The game has no subtitles at all, including during cutscenes, so I can't say I know a ton about the story.
There's a main plotline is about bioweapons, but I honestly can't say I know much about it.
Perhaps it doesn't deserve a zero in story because I don't know it, and really deserves a zero in accessibility.
To be fair to the story, I'll give it a pass, but I don't believe I'm missing out at all.

### Gameplay 1/5

This is going to be an elongated list of greivances, since there wasn't anything particularly redeeming about the gameplay.

To kick things off, let's talk about the most obvious flaw that I saw coming before I even got the game. Controlling a third-person shooter using a touch screen and directional pad is a nightmare. They've designed the controls so that they can be played "one-handed" but it's so difficult to hold the game and use a stylus at the same time that I can't play for more than 20 minutes before I start to cramp. I initially used just my thumb for the touch screen, but aiming was so difficult that it was nearly impossible to kill anyone.

As if bad controls weren't bad enough, the enemies aer also incredibly difficult, even for a normal game. Killing a standard enemy takes about 8 shots or more depending on where you hit them. The pistol itself only carries about a 10 round clip, so you'll be using a clip per person.Then, because of the limitations of Nintendo DS, the ammo that enemies drop, which is often barely more than it took to kill them, will disappear if you don't grab it soon enough.

Before you ask, yes, headshots do more damage. However, getting those headshots is impossibly difficult. The weapon spread is insanely wide, so even if you take a good long time to line up the shot and go for it, you'll miss far more than half of those shots. And that's just for normal enemies, the boss enemies are far more of a pain; not only do they take multiple clips to kill, but often you're in an area with limited cover and resources.
