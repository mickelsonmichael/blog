### Story: 1/5

Overall, I can't say I know much about the story of this game. The game has no subtitles at all, including during cutscenes, and I generally play the game while watching television or next to my fiance while she's on her phone, situations where I don't want to have gunshots resounding throughout the room. Because of that, I have very little clue what is going on, there's a main plotline is about bioweapons, but I honestly can't say I know much about it beyond what the objective tracker tells me to do. Perhaps it doesn't deserve a zero in story, perhaps it's a banner game with exceptional plot, but anyone with any kind of hearing impairment or broken speakers will agree that without audio, it's rubbish.

Granted, I don't expect much from a Nintentdo DS game in terms of story. It's meant to be portable and short, but if you're going to lack in story then you need to make up for it in [gameplay](#gameplay). But there's bad news on that front...

### Gameplay 1/5

To kick things off, let's talk about the most obvious flaw that I saw coming before I even got the game. Controlling a third-person shooter using a touch screen and directional pad is a nightmare. They've designed the controls so that they can be played "one-handed" but it's so difficult to hold the game and use a stylus at the same time that I can't play for more than 20 minutes before I start to cramp. I initially used just my thumb for the touch screen, but aiming was so difficult that it was nearly impossible to kill anyone.

As if bad controls weren't bad enough, the enemies aer also incredibly difficult, even for a normal game. Killing a standard enemy takes about 8 shots or more depending on where you hit them. The pistol itself only carries about a 10 round clip, so you'll be using a clip per person.Then, because of the limitations of Nintendo DS, the ammo that enemies drop, which is often barely more than it took to kill them, will disappear if you don't grab it soon enough.

Before you ask, yes, headshots do more damage. However, getting those headshots is impossibly difficult. The weapon spread is insanely wide, so even if you take a good long time to line up the shot and go for it, you'll miss far more than half of those shots. And that's just for normal enemies, the boss enemies are far more of a pain; not only do they take multiple clips to kill, but often you're in an area with limited cover and resources.

Next we stroll up to the "stealth" mechanic, where Bond hunches over slightly and moves a little more slowly. It's awful, it becomes a game more like [The Classroom](https://armorgames.com/play/11/the-classroom) flash game because you aren't really capable of taking down enemies, since they're so tanky and headshots are a pipe dream, so you end up sneaking along and hoping nobody sees you. If they _do_ manage to catch you creeping along, then a batallion of extra troops will come streaming in, guns blazing. And as I said before, the ammo used to kill these new opponents is not outpaced by the ammo they drop; essentially, once you're caught, just let yourself be killed and start over, or else you'll just run dry on ammo and find yourself stuck between a rock and an empty magazine.

Our last aspect, and the one the _coup de gr√¢ce_ to my playthrough of this game, are the boss fights. I mentioned before how the bosses are tough, but not all of them are just outright shoot-fests. The one that finally did me in was a boat-based boss fight. You begin the fight with your opponent jumping into a speedboat and you jumping into a different boat to begin pursuit. What follows is a harrowing journey through dozens of boats, explosive barrels, and what can only be described as a bullet-proof individual. Waves of enemies continue to show up and need to be dealt with (luckily for us they were foolish enough to carry an explosve barrel on their boats), you then need to shoot at oncoming explosive barrels. Failing to shoot one of these explosive barrels isn't an instant loss, but it does weaken you so that either the other boats or the boss himself can clip you pretty easily. Finally the boss is impossibly difficult to kill; constant firing with an Uzi leads to nothing and only serves to tickle the health bar.

The developers were kind enough to give your Uzi unlimited ammo, but that isn't enough, because the final nail in the coffin is that there are no checkpoints in this sequence. So you end up retrying and retrying and wasting an hour on a single level of a crappy game. I initially had thought it's possible that this was the final boss, but a brief glance at a Wiki leads me to believe there's more to the story.

At this point, I tapped out, and I probably won't be playing the game again. I did purchase the sequel (or at least I think it's a sequel), so I'm hoping when I finally get up the gumption to play it that the developers have ironed out the issues.
