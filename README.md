### What does the name mean?

When my girlfriend (a food scientist) and I first got our own WiFi when we moved in to a new place together, I was tasked with coming up with our WiFi name. I considered several puns, but landed on "FoodNetwork" to combine her food and my programming. However, for the sake of not being in trouble with the _actual_ FoodNetwork, I've decided to try out a slight riff on the name to make it less... _sueable_.
